## Motivation
My girlfriend and I play this game often with friends, and I always lose and she always wins. So, developing this game was a way to train so I can one day beat her. 

## Skills and Concepts Learned
* Classes and OOP 
* Unit testing
* Why we use `if __name__ == '__main__':`
* Using the debugger in VSCode
* Breaking down problems into small chunks
* Using OBStudio for display capture, then converting to GIF with [convertio.co](https://convertio.co/)
