# Rummi
Simple CLI implementation of the card game [Rummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummy)

![Rummi Demo](https://github.com/rjweis/Rummi/blob/master/rummi_demo.gif)

## Motivation
My girlfriend and I play this game often with friends, and I always lose and she always wins. So, developing this game was a way to train so I can one day beat her. :)

## Skills and Concepts Learned
* Classes and OOP 
* Unit testing
* Why we use `if __name__ == '__main__':`
* Using the debugger in VSCode
* Appreciating 'flat is better than nested'
* Naming variables, functions, and classes effectively is important but difficult
* Refactoring code can speed up debugging and improve readability
* Using OBStudio for display capture, then converting to GIF with [convertio.co](https://convertio.co/)

## Future Work
* Add 'AI' to play against
* Use probability to optimize decision making at each turn (i.e., should a card be drawn from the deck? the discard pile? the whole discard pile?)
* Add GUI with Pygame
